\section{10 Oct 23 - Activity: Matching Boundary Conditions and Plotting
the
Potential}\label{oct-23---activity-matching-boundary-conditions-and-plotting-the-potential}

\subsection{Azimuthally Symmetric
Solutions}\label{azimuthally-symmetric-solutions}

As we saw, azimuthally symmetric solutions, the electric potential is
independent of \(\phi\) and the solutions are of the form:

\[V(r,\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{l=0}^\infty \left(A_{nl} r^n + \frac{B_{nl}}{r^{n+1}}\right) P_l(\cos\theta)\]

where \(P_l(\cos\theta)\) are the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials}{Legendre
polynomials}. The coefficients \(A_{nl}\) and \(B_{nl}\) are determined
by the boundary conditions. We will practice solving for these
coefficients in this activity.

\textbf{✅ Do this}

\subsubsection{Sphere of constant surface
potential}\label{sphere-of-constant-surface-potential}

Consider a sphere of with a radius \(a\). If the potential on the
surface is \(V_0\), what is the potential inside and outside the sphere?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider the radial solutions (what doesn't blow up?)
\item
  Consider the polar angle solutions, what has to be true? What does
  that say about terms with \(l>0\)?
\item
  Write down the solution inside and outside the sphere.
\item
  Make a heat map plot (in \(x\) and \(y\)) of the potential inside and
  outside the sphere. You can set \(a=1\) and \(V_0=1\) if that helps.

\subsubsection{Sphere of variable
potential}\label{sphere-of-variable-potential}

Consider a sphere of with a radius \(a\). If the potential on the
surface is \(V(\theta)\), what is the potential inside and outside the
sphere?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider the radial solutions (what doesn't blow up?)
\item
  Consider the polar angle solutions, what has to be true? Can you say
  anything about them?
\item
  What if \(V(\theta) = V_0 \cos(\theta)\)? What is the potential inside
  and outside the sphere?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{A thick spherical shell}\label{a-thick-spherical-shell}

Suppose you have a spherical shell of inner radius \(a\) and outer
radius \(b\), and you know the electric potential on the inner
(\(V(a,\theta) = V_a(\theta)\)) and outer
(\(V(b,\theta) = V_b(\theta)\)) surfaces. You want to find the electric
potential \(V(r,\theta)\) inside the hole (\(r<a\)) and outside the
shell (\(r>b\)).

Let's allow:

\[V_a(\theta) = V_{a0} + V_{a1} \cos(\theta)\]
\[V_b(\theta) = V_{b0} + V_{b1} \cos(\theta)\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the general solution? (all three regions)
\item
  What are the boundary conditions for \(r\)?
\item
  What terms are left in the general solutions?
\item
  Find the unique solution for \(V(r,\theta)\) inside the hole (\(r<a\))
  and outside the shell (\(r>b\)).
\end{enumerate}

What do you do in the case of \(V_a(\theta) = f(\theta)\) and
\(V_b(\theta) = g(\theta)\) - generic functions?

\subsubsection{Example of Polarization}\label{example-of-polarization}

\textbf{✅ Do this}

Put a metal sphere of radius \(a\) in a uniform electric field
\(\vec{E} = E_0 \hat{z}\).

What is the potential inside and outside the sphere?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Draw the picture and write down the boundary conditions. What is the
  potential everywhere on a metal?
\item
  What general solution do you need to use? How do you know?
\item
  What are the boundary conditions for the radial solutions? The polar
  angle solutions?
\item
  Match your boundary conditions to your general solution. What is the
  potential inside and outside the sphere?
\item
  Make a heat map plot (in \(x\) and \(y\)) of the potential inside and
  outside the sphere. You can set \(a=1\) and \(E_0=1\) if that helps.
\item
  (challenge) Find the polarization charge density on the surface of the
  sphere. What is the total charge on the sphere?
