\section{Welcome to Mathematical Modeling in
Physics}\label{welcome-to-mathematical-modeling-in-physics}

PHY 415, called, ``Mathematical Methods for Physicists'' is a course the
brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use
in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we
will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical
descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and
analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.

To get a sense of the course, please read all the pages associated with
our syllabus.

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}

In this course, you will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  investigate physical systems using a variety of tools and approaches,
\item
  construct and document a reproducible process for those
  investigations,
\item
  use analytical, computational, and graphical approaches to answer
  specific questions in those investigations,
\item
  provide evidence of the quality of work using a variety of sources,
  and
\item
  collaborate effectively and contribute to a inclusive learning
  environment
\end{itemize}
