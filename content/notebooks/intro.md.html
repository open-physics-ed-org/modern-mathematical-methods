<h1 id="welcome-to-mathematical-modeling-in-physics">Welcome to Mathematical Modeling in Physics</h1>
<p>PHY 415, called, "Mathematical Methods for Physicists" is a course the brings together many of the mathematical approaches that we commonly use in physics and apply them to variety of problems. In this course, we will take a modeling-based approach where we focus on the mathematical descriptions of physical phenomenon and determine what mathematical and analytical approaches are useful in exploring those models.</p>
