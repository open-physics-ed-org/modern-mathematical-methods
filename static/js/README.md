# static/js/site.js

This file contains site-wide JavaScript for accessibility and UI enhancements:
- Dark mode toggle (persists user preference)
- Keyboard accessibility for the dark mode toggle
- Focus styles for skip links
- (Optional) Mobile navigation support

All interactive JS should be placed here and loaded on every page via the HTML template.
